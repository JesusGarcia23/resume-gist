## Summary

I was a full-time student at the Center Technological University (UNITEC) in Venezuela working towards a degree in
Industrial production engineering. In August 2017, I emigrated to the US, and started working as a Graphic Designer

I’m a team player, Problem-solving, Multi-task, detailist, someone who feels a big passion for technology, seeking for
